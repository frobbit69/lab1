				<h2>History</h2>
				<p>
        The pointed cat known in the West as "Siamese", 
        recognised for its distinctive markings, is one of several breeds of cats from Siam described and illustrated in manuscripts called 
        "Tamra Maew" (Cat Poems). The "Tamra Maew" is estimated to have been written from the 14th to the 18th century.[5] In 1878, U.S. President Rutherford B. 
        Hayes received the first documented Siamese to reach the United States. The cat, named "Siam," was sent from Bangkok to the American Consul.[6] In 1884, 
        the British Consul-General in Bangkok, Edward Blencowe Gould (1847–1916),[7] brought a breeding pair of the cats, Pho and Mia (พ่อและแม่), back to Britain as 
        a gift for his sister, Lilian Jane Gould (who, married in 1895 as Lilian Jane Veley,[8] went on to co-found the Siamese Cat Club in 1901). In 1885, Gould's UK 
        cats Pho and Mia produced three Siamese kittens—Duen Ngai (เดือนหงาย), Kalohom (กลาโหม), and Khromata (กรมท่า)—who were shown with their parents that same year 
        at London's Crystal Palace Show. Their appearance and behaviour attracted attention, but all three of the kittens died soon after the show, their cause of death 
        not documented.
